# Label Lounge

This is a public resource for sharing common printable label templates for multiple software packages.

Most printable labels (e.g. Avery labels) offer a free template when you buy their products. Often though the template is in a single file format such as Microsoft Word which cannot be used in say Adobe Illustrator or InDesign.

The idea behind this repository is to simply make these available in multiple formats and save designers the hassle of conversion! These are **not official templates** and **may contain errors**.
